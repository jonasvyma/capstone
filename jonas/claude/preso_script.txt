=== 3-MINUTE PRESENTATION SCRIPT (BULLET FORMAT) ===

INTRO — 15 sec
• Hi everyone, I’m Jonas. This project explores collectible pricing — specifically Pokémon cards and Star Wars figures.
• The goal: uncover how condition, authenticity, and rarity shape market value.
• The data combines real historical prices and authentic sales records.

POKÉMON CARD ANALYSIS

DATA OVERVIEW — 15 sec
• Dataset is complete, clean, and mostly numeric.
• Prices show a strong right-skew: a few expensive cards pull the average up.
• XXXMedian values and log-scaled plots are better for interpretation.

TOP 10 MOST VALUABLE POKÉMON CARDS — 25 sec
• The highest-value cards cluster around early-generation grails.
• “Charizard Base Set” dominates across conditions.
• Median prices highlight consistency — not just one-off sales.
• Observation: collector nostalgia remains the main price driver.

TOP 10 POKÉMON SETS BY AVG GRADED PRICE — 20 sec
• Vintage sets (Base Set, Neo, Jungle) lead overall.
• Modern sets with special illustrations rank high but show more volatility.
• Insight: legacy sets provide long-term stability.

PRICE DISTRIBUTION BY CONDITION — 25 sec
• Boxed or graded items skew heavily upward.
• The “graded” condition adds a visible premium on the log-scale boxplot.
• Condition and authenticity have multiplicative effects.
• Takeaway: grading creates a strong pricing tier.

GROWTH ANALYSIS & TOP 3 BY GROWTH — 25 sec
• Price growth is cyclical, not linear.
• Peaks align with major card releases or hype waves.
• Top growth cards combine nostalgia and PSA/BGS certification.
• Long-term investors benefit from holding iconic cards during hype cycles.

STAR WARS FIGURE ANALYSIS

DATA OVERVIEW — 10 sec
• Dataset mirrors Pokémon but includes authenticity (0/1) and condition (MoC vs loose).
• Skewed distributions again make median the preferred statistic.

TOP 10 MOST VALUABLE FIGURES (BY CATEGORY) — 25 sec
• MoC (Mint on Card) + Authentic = highest average selling price.
• Loose + Not Authentic = lowest value tier.
• Packaging and authenticity compound to lift price.
• Clear stratification: condition and trustworthiness drive market hierarchy.

TOP 10 MOST SOLD FIGURES — 15 sec
• Most-sold figures are common characters, not the most valuable.
• High volume ≠ high price — these serve as “velocity” products.
• Premium items have fewer but higher-value sales.

PRICE DISTRIBUTION BY CATEGORY — 20 sec
• Boxplots show higher medians and wider spreads for authenticated items.
• Log scaling highlights the multiplicative price jump between condition levels.

GROWTH ANALYSIS — 20 sec
• Median prices trend up over time, with visible event-based spikes.
• MoC Authentic figures sustain appreciation longer than others.
