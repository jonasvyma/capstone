=== 3-Minute Presentation Script ===
(Opening — 10 sec)
Hi everyone, I’m Jonas. In three minutes I’ll walk you through key takeaways from my Collectibles Pricing Analysis covering Pokémon cards and Star Wars figures.

(Pokémon — Data Overview — 20 sec)
We start with a clean dataset of card sales enriched with rarity, set, and condition. Most columns are complete, and prices are right‑skewed, so medians and log‑views are more reliable than raw means.

(Pokémon — Top 15 Most Valuable Cards — 35 sec)
This bar chart ranks the highest median graded prices. The story: premiums concentrate in a small set of grail cards. Variants with iconic artwork and early‑set provenance dominate. Outliers exist, but median ranking reduces noise from single expensive sales.

(Pokémon — Top 10 Sets by Avg Graded Price — 25 sec)
A set‑level roll‑up shows value clusters. Vintage and special‑illustration heavy sets sit at the top. Modern sets with high chase rarity can break in, but consistency still favors established sets.

(Pokémon — Price Distribution by Condition — 25 sec)
Box/graded vs loose/used separates clearly. Graded consistently shifts the distribution right with a heavier upper tail. This quantifies the “condition premium” and motivates authentication as a value lever.

(Pokémon — Growth Analysis & Top 3 by Growth — 30 sec)
Time‑series lines show uneven appreciation: spikes around releases or hype cycles, then mean‑reversion. Top growth cards share two traits: strong brand nostalgia and grading activity. The takeaway is that momentum is episodic; holding quality beats chasing peaks.

(Star Wars — Data Overview — 15 sec)
Structure mirrors Pokémon: figure, condition (MoC vs loose), authenticity, price, year. Distributions are again right‑skewed, so we rely on medians.

(Star Wars — Top 10 Most Valuable by Grading Status — 30 sec)
Four panels split MoC/Loose × Authentic/Not. MoC + authentic leads, Loose + not authentic lags. The gap illustrates how packaging and certification stack multiplicatively on price.

(Star Wars — Top 10 Best Selling by Grading Status — 20 sec)
High volume doesn’t equal high value. Common characters dominate counts; premium variants dominate price. Inventory strategy should separate “velocity SKUs” from “margin SKUs.”

(Star Wars — Price Distribution by Grading Status — 20 sec)
Boxplots show dispersion and outliers. Certification widens the spread upwards; medians step up cleanly across tiers. This supports a tiered pricing framework.

(Star Wars — Growth & Top 3 by Growth — 25 sec)
Median price by month trends upwards in cycles, with authentic MoC showing the most durable growth. Peaks align with media cycles and collector events.

(Closing — 15 sec)
In short: value concentrates in authenticated, high‑condition items; volume concentrates in common items. Use medians, trim outliers, and segment by condition × authenticity to make decisions. Thanks!
